#
# Warning: Invalid shaders can cause Ghostty to become unusable such as by
# causing the window to be completely black. If this happens, you can
# unset this configuration to disable the shader.
#
# On Linux, this requires OpenGL 4.2. Ghostty typically only requires
# OpenGL 3.3, but custom shaders push that requirement up to 4.2.
#
# The shader API is identical to the Shadertoy API: you specify a `mainImage`
# function and the available uniforms match Shadertoy. The iChannel0 uniform
# is a texture containing the rendered terminal screen.
#
# If the shader fails to compile, the shader will be ignored. Any errors
# related to shader compilation will not show up as configuration errors
# and only show up in the log, since shader compilation happens after
# configuration loading on the dedicated render thread.  For interactive
# development, use [shadertoy.com](https://shadertoy.com).
#
# This can be repeated multiple times to load multiple shaders. The shaders

#
# If this is set to `false`, the terminal and custom shader will only render
# when the terminal is updated. This is more efficient but the shader will
# not animate.
#
# This can also be set to `always`, which will always run the animation
# loop regardless of whether the terminal is focused or not. The animation
# loop will still only run when custom shaders are used. Note that this

# Possible notifications are:
#
#   - `clipboard-copy` (default: true) - Show a notification when text is copied
#     to the clipboard.
#
# To specify a notification to enable, specify the name of the notification.
# To specify a notification to disable, prefix the name with `no-`. For
# example, to disable `clipboard-copy`, set this configuration to
# `no-clipboard-copy`. To enable it, set this configuration to `clipboard-copy`.
#
# Multiple notifications can be enabled or disabled by separating them

# If anything other than false, fullscreen mode on macOS will not use the

# Important: tabs DO NOT WORK in this mode. Non-native fullscreen removes
# the titlebar and macOS native tabs require the titlebar. If you use tabs,
# you should not use this mode.
#
# If you fullscreen a window with tabs, the currently focused tab will
# become fullscreen while the others will remain in a separate window in
# the background. You can switch to that window using normal window-switching

# will return to the tabbed state it was in before.
#
# Allowable values are:
#
#   * `visible-menu` - Use non-native macOS fullscreen, keep the menu bar visible
#   * `true` - Use non-native macOS fullscreen, hide the menu bar
#   * `false` - Use native macOS fullscreen

# The style of the macOS titlebar. Available values are: "native",
# "transparent", "tabs", and "hidden".
#
# The "native" style uses the native macOS titlebar with zero customization.
# The titlebar will match your window theme (see `window-theme`).
#
# The "transparent" style is the same as "native" but the titlebar will
# be transparent and allow your window background color to come through.
# This makes a more seamless window appearance but looks a little less
# typical for a macOS application and may not work well with all themes.
#
# The "transparent" style will also update in real-time to dynamic
# changes to the window background color, e.g. via OSC 11. To make this
# more aesthetically pleasing, this only happens if the terminal is
# a window, tab, or split that borders the top of the window. This
# avoids a disjointed appearance where the titlebar color changes
# but all the topmost terminals don't match.
#
# The "tabs" style is a completely custom titlebar that integrates the
# tab bar into the titlebar. This titlebar always matches the background
# color of the terminal. There are some limitations to this style:
# On macOS 13 and below, saved window state will not restore tabs correctly.
# macOS 14 does not have this issue and any other macOS version has not
# been tested.
#
# The "hidden" style hides the titlebar. Unlike `window-decoration = false`,
# however, it does not remove the frame from the window or cause it to have
# squared corners. Changing to or from this option at run-time may affect
# existing windows in buggy ways.
#
# When "hidden", the top titlebar area can no longer be used for dragging
# the window. To drag the window, you can use option+click on the resizable
# areas of the frame to drag the window. This is a standard macOS behavior
# and not something Ghostty enables.
#
# The default value is "transparent". This is an opinionated choice
# but its one I think is the most aesthetically pleasing and works in
# most cases.
#
# Changing this option at runtime only applies to new windows.

#
# Valid values are:

#   * `visible` - Show the proxy icon.
#   * `hidden` - Hide the proxy icon.
#
# The default value is `visible`.
#
# This setting can be changed at runtime and will affect all currently

# macOS doesn't have a distinct "alt" key and instead has the "option"
# key which behaves slightly differently. On macOS by default, the

# undesirable if you want to use "option" as an "alt" key for keybindings
# in terminal programs or shells.
#
# This configuration lets you change the behavior so that option is treated
# as alt.
#
# The default behavior (unset) will depend on your active keyboard
# layout. If your keyboard layout is one of the keyboard layouts listed
# below, then the default value is "true". Otherwise, the default
# value is "false". Keyboard layouts with a default value of "true" are:
#
#   - U.S. Standard
#   - U.S. International
#
# Note that if an *Option*-sequence doesn't produce a printable character, it
# will be treated as *Alt* regardless of this setting. (e.g. `alt+ctrl+a`).
#
# Explicit values that can be set:
#
# If `true`, the *Option* key will be treated as *Alt*. This makes terminal
# sequences expecting *Alt* to work properly, but will break Unicode input
# sequences on macOS if you use them via the *Alt* key.
#
# You may set this to `false` to restore the macOS *Alt* key unicode
# sequences but this will break terminal sequences expecting *Alt* to work.

#
# Other caveats:
